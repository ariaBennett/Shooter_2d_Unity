Project Description:
	In our Project Description we will layout a very basic concept for the
	game we are to make.  As we advance in game types and scope of production
	we will also advance in the documentation of these projects to more fully
	realize the project at the beginning of development.
	One step at a time.

Learning Objectives:
	Introduciton to assets creation
	Introduction to game scripting
	Introduction to GUI elements
	Introduction to Input
	Introduction to Events
	Introduction to Scene Loading

Production Time:
	Setup	15 minutes
	Assets	60 minutes
	Player	30 minutes
	Enemy	25 Minutes
	Menus	40 Minutes
	GUI		45 minutes
	Build	20 minutes
	Review	10 minutes

High Concept:
	A high speed mouse clicking game. Using the mouse, click on 
	and destroy as many shapes as you can to earn points and 
	a high score.
	
	Hopefully, make the game better than that, too.

Controls:
	Use the left mouse button to select on shapes and destroy them.

Mockup Assets:
	Targets
	Explosion
	
	
Potential Ideas:
	Music based game where key inputs are strengthened 
	if pressed in time with certain beats/weakened when pressed off beat.
	
	"Laser Beam" could grow and shrink with the bass.
	Additional power-ups could enable channels, ie high hat.
	player could fly up a music bar
	think Guitar Hero but as a top down shooter, and with dubstep (ie heavy drop = hold space)
